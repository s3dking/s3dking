    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 140%;">
        I am 14 years old. I've been learning coding for about 6 months now. Only recently have i started to code websites. <br />
        The coding languages that i am learning/understand are, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All very simple languages. <br />
        I am becoming very proficient in coding discord bots. I've made a very useful discord bot with many features and it is soon to take off. <br />
        I am thinking about switching to Linux OS because i've heard it is a good OS and it looks cool! <br />
        And that concludes my introduction... GOODBYE!
